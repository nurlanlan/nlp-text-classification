- Created project structure folders.
- Next: choose a dataset and run first exploration notebook.
## Day 3
- Loaded SMS Spam dataset.
- Dataset has labels (spam / ham) and raw text.
- Initial exploration done.

## Day 4
- Analyzed text length as a simple numerical feature.
- Computed message length for each SMS.
- Compared spam vs ham messages using basic statistics (count, mean, min, max).
- Observed that spam messages tend to have different length characteristics.
- Learned that even very simple features (like text length) can carry useful information in NLP.

## Day 5
- Implemented basic text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing non-letter characters).
- Created a cleaned version of the original text suitable for machine learning models.
- Learned why raw text cannot be directly used by ML algorithms.
- Applied Bag of Words (CountVectorizer) to convert text into numerical vectors.
- Applied TF-IDF to understand how word importance is weighted across documents.
- Understood the difference between simple word counts and TF-IDF representations.
